# A3MD

** We are releasing the code along this week (first week of June)**

MPNN + Analytic Density Model = Accurate electron densities

## Summary

A3MD is a machine-learning framework for electron density prediction. It combines a predictor based on 
*message-passing* neural networks with an expansion in terms of a sum of Slaters. It converts the electron density
into a sum of weighted electron density deformations of the isotropic electron density.
